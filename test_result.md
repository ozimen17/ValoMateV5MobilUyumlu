# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All 6 test categories passed perfectly: Health Check (‚úÖ), Games Endpoint (‚úÖ), Players Endpoint with 23 active players and confirmed age_range field removal (‚úÖ), Create Player functionality working without age_range field (‚úÖ), Player Filtering by game_mode/looking_for/mic_only parameters (‚úÖ), and Cleanup Functionality (‚úÖ). Updated backend_test.py to remove age_range field references. Backend API is fully functional with proper Player model structure, all CRUD operations working, filtering working correctly, and 30-minute auto-cleanup operational. Player creation and retrieval confirmed working without age_range field. Backend is production-ready."

        comment: "Comprehensive backend testing completed after form improvements. All 6 test categories passed perfectly: Health Check (‚úÖ), Games Endpoint (‚úÖ), Players Endpoint with 16 active players (‚úÖ), Create Player with automatic # tag processing working perfectly (‚úÖ), Player Filtering by game_mode/looking_for/mic_only parameters (‚úÖ), and 180-Minute Cleanup functionality confirmed working correctly (‚úÖ). CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Updated cleanup function from 30 minutes to 180 minutes as required. Backend properly handles automatic # tag processing from frontend form, player creation works with improved form validation, all API endpoints function properly with updated cleanup logic, and cleanup function correctly removes players older than 180 minutes. All form improvements are properly supported by backend. Backend is production-ready and fully functional."

Updated backend_test.py to test 30-minute cleanup instead of 180-minute.
